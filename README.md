The Sales Prediction project is designed to forecast future sales by analysing historical data and various influencing factors such as product type, store location, advertising spend, and seasonal trends.

Data preprocessing was carried out using Pandas and NumPy to clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical features. For exploratory data analysis, Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to visualize sales patterns, seasonal variations, and relationships between key features.

Multiple regression models were implemented using Scikit-learn, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost

Model performance was evaluated using:

R² Score – for variance explanation

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – for average error measurement

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – for error magnitude assessment

The best-performing model delivers highly accurate sales forecasts, providing valuable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and budgeting decisions.
